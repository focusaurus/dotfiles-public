# dotfiles and home directory

This repo contains my dotfiles - unix configuration files that typically live in one's home directory. This repo represents the git-tracked subset of my home directory.

## How this setup works with git

At the moment the approach I'm using is my actual home directory is a checked-out git work tree, as opposed to any symlink-based approach. It's primarily based on 2 articles

- [How to store dotfiles](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) tutorial from Atlassian
- [Michael Sloan's approach](https://github.com/mgsloan/mgsloan-dotfiles/blob/master/env/home-dir-git.md)
