Use the "m" command to set a mark. Can be any letter, so `ma` sets mark a at the current cursor position.

Go to marks with `a `b `c etc. That's the exact position.

Go to the beginning of the line containing the mark with 'a 'b 'c etc.


To yank something, navigate to the start, mark it with ma, navigate to the end, yank it with
y`a. If you want to copy to system clipboard, :CopyToClipboard. Or you can do it in on flurry with:

"+y`a
