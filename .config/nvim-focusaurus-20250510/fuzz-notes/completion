- with CoC and tabnine the completion UI is called a popup menu (pum)
- The default bindings to choose are <C-p> and <C-n> which are actually fine
- no <CR> needed
The dialog boxes that come up for completions are actually a native vim construct, not created by coc

You can navigate them with <c-n> and <c-p>, just like other native vim constructs (command history for example)

Vim calls it the pum, for pop-up menu. There's a function called pumvisible() that returns true when it's open

So you can say something like this:
" <tab>: completion.
inoremap <expr> <tab> (pumvisible()) ? "\<c-n>" : "\<tab>"
inoremap <expr> <s-tab> (pumvisible()) ? "\<c-p>" : "\<s-tab>"

This is saying:
- if the popup menu is open, type <c-n>
- otherwise, type <tab>

I used to use this and use tab/s-tab for everything but to be honest at some point I got used to c-n/c-p and they feel much more ergonomic to me. But you have an ergodox and that probably has a nicer way to hit tab/s-tab

For insert mode, <c-p> triggers the basic completion popup menu (pum).
